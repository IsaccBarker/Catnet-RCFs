<p>Why does the Internet need fixing?
The internet hasnâ€™t been around that long in the grand scheme of things, and yet it already needs replacing. This is not due to bad design, far from it. The internet is a technological wonder that was revolutionized global communications. However, it was designed in an era with limited computing. The global rise of hugely complicated machines, at a competitive price, was not predicted in the slightest. In other words, the infrastructure is ageing, and the attacks are getting smarter. With all the attacks we are seeing, it is almost impossible to not think that we need a replacement. Hence, Catnet is born.</p>
